# ImmunoRepertoire
Antibody repertoire analysis pipeline
fastq -> fasta -> igblast align -> extract CDR3/variable seq/V segment sequences

## Requirements

###1.PEAR: a fast and accurate Illumina Paired-End reAd mergeR

Zhang et al (2014) Bioinformatics 30(5): 614-620 | doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt593

You can get it from [PEAR](https://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/)


### 2.Stand-alone IgBLAST: A tool for immunoglobulin (IG) and T cell receptor (TR) V domain sequences

IgBLAST was developed at NCBI to facilitate analysis of immunoglobulin variable domain sequences (IgBLAST has recently been extended to perform analysis for T cell receptor (TR) sequences). It uses BLAST search algorithm.

You can get it from [Standalone IgBLAST](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/faq.html#standalone)
